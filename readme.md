## Challenges
1. **GraphQL Query** - the issues was simply a non existen field being fetched from the `GetAllTransactions` query -> `reciept`

2. **Wallet Connection** - the problem here was that web3-onboard requires a wallets array to be provided that contains walletInit functions through which the library seems to connect to the wallets - in our case we had to provide the injectedModule from `injected-wallets` which contains the mechanism to detect browser available wallets, in our case - metamask. I did a bit of refactoring here as well:

 Since the connection of the wallet requires performing a side effect, to be more consistent I went ahead and extracted a new saga/effect function to `sagas` called connectWallet and introduced new Actions (`ConnectWallet`, `ConnecWalletSuccess`) and updated the reducer and redux state to also store the relevant metamask wallet information after a successful connection to the wallet is made. This gave us the additional benefit of having a single source of truth for the wallet and read the wallet info inside the Navigation and also for populating the Send Transaction Form.

3. **Redux Saga (Investigate and fix the `SEND_TRANSACTION` saga)**

The main problem here was that the hardcoded value for the transaction was in wei which ended up being too large of a number to be precisely represented as a raw javascript number. There seemed to be different solutions available here but what I did was just pass in the value as a string instead of a number.

4. **Navigation and Redirection**
 
 Once the transaction was successful inside the `sendTransaction` saga I added a call to the `navigate` function coming from the naive router implementation. Ideally there would be a lot more and better options some of them include passing the router object/navigation function as a context to the sagas or using a redux-react-router library that would allow dispatching actions for changing the location but this required a lot of configuration and to keep it simple I went with a straight call to the `navigate` function inside the send transaction sage.

5. **Wire in the Form**
 
  Here I used the `useForm` hook from react-hook-form and it's utilities to easily validate and keep track of the state of the form. I did the following steps:

   5.1 Read the sender address from the connected wallet (available in the redux state so I could just do `useSelector`).

   5.2 Introduce new redux state (actions, reducers) for the transaction modal's loading and open/close state. I did that so the sagas (send transaction saga) would also be able to open/close and set loading state of the modal when form is submitted successfully.

   5.3 Wire up each of the fields through the `register` method from useForm (keep sender address disabled as we don't want to change that and want to always send the transaction from the connected wallet's address).

   5.5 Introduce validation rules:
   
       * `recipient address` - to be a valid wallet address (using the ethers utility library)
   
       * `amount` - valid numeric, required value
   5.6 On successful submit dispatch a `SEND_TRANSACTION_ACTION` and pass in the form data as a payload
   
   5.7. Update the send transaction saga to get the `to` and `value` values from the action's payload instead of passing a hardcoded value and a random address.

7. **UI**

Investigating the issue it seemed it could be solved in a lot of ways - the simplest would be to remove the `hidden` class which was only applied for devices below `sm` and would hide the button. But looking further it seemed the intention was not to just show the `connect` button at all times but rather hide it in a toggleable menu for mobile by using the tailwind utility classes for collapse expand functionality. This required to include an addtional `@preline/collapse` package in order to work properly and also adding a toggle button inside the navigation component that would only be visible for mobile devices (below `sm`).

8. **Human Readable Values**
For this I introduced a new `EthersFormtter` component that utilises the `ethers` library and allows converting from any ethereum unit to another. Then I used that component on both the transaction list and the single transaction page. It could have been just a utility function instead of a component but I find it easy to use this way.
